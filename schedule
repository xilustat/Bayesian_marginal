(1) The current setting: n=200, p=50, coef = unif(0.1,0.5), coefficients are "far away from each other", error = n(0,1) and t(2).

(2) based on the setting in (1), please also calculate AUC(SD) under other heavy tailed distributions:  Laplace(mu,b) with 
mean mu=0 and scale parameter b=2, and LogNormal(0,1). So now you have AUC(SD) for 4 error distributions

(3) based on the setting in (2), change p from 50 to 500 and 1000, respectively. 

(4) based on the setting in (1), change coefficients to "close to each other", error = n(0,1) and t(2).

(5) based on the setting in (2), change coefficients to "close to each other"

(6) based on the setting in (3), change coefficients to "close to each other"

Summarize results in table. Just report AUC with SD. No need to draw ROC for each case.
